# Description

This project is for a code challenge. The goal of the project is to create a REST app that exposes endpoints to:

- Register a user with basic information, username, and password
- Upload, view, and delete images after authorizing the user’s name and password.
- Associate the uploaded list of images with the user profile
- View the user’s basic information and pictures.

The project should leverage the Imgur API to integrate with Imgur for uploading, viewing, and deleting images.
